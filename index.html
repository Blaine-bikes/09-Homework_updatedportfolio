      <p>My name is Blair Perkes, I am a recent student at the Utah State University, and I am studying MIS. I am
        just beginning, but found a large interest in programming and learning how to.</p>
    <p>I'm 21 years old, I enjoy the outdoors and doing anything outside. Including but
        not limited to biking, hiking, climbing, running, kayaking, rafting, hiking, backpacking, and so on and
        so forth. If I ever have time on my hands I like to be with my family and get outside and do something
        fun with them.</p>
        <p>I'm married to my amazing wife that loves anything adventure with me as well.</p>
